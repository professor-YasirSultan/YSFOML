# YSFOML (Yasir Sultan File Operations Markup Language) Specification and Documentation, Version 1.0.3

## 1. Introduction

YSFOML (Yasir Sultan File Operations Markup Language) is a simple, human-readable markup language designed to define and execute file system operations. It provides a structured way to specify actions like creating, modifying, querying, and managing files and folders. YSFOML is particularly useful for enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) to interact with file systems in a controlled and auditable manner, always with a critical human review step. It is processed by a dedicated parser application that interprets the defined actions and executes them on the local file system.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 YSFOML Block Structure

YSFOML operations are defined within `<YSFOML>` and `</YSFOML>` tags. Each block represents a single file system operation.

**Syntax:**

```ysfoml
<YSFOML>
action: [action_name];
[parameter1]:[value1];
[parameter2]:[value2]
...
</YSFOML>
[Optional Content associated with the action]
